### ðŸŒ   **Key Features:**
CIDM can can resolve catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect to learn new customization tasks in a concept-incremental
manner. Our work mainly has two parts: 
1. We propose a new practical Concept-Incremental Flexible Customization (CIFC) problem, where the main challenges are catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect. To address the challenges in the CIFC problem, we develop a novel Concept-Incremental text-to-image Diffusion Model (CIDM),
which can learn new personalized concepts continuously for versatile concept customization.
2. We devise a concept consolidation loss and an elastic weight aggregation module to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of old personalized concepts, by exploring task-specific/task-shared knowledge and aggregating all low-rank weights of old concepts based on their contributions in the CIFC.
3. We develop a context-controllable synthesis strategy to tackle the concept neglect. It can control the contexts of synthesized image according to user-provided conditions, by enhancing expressive ability of region features with layer-wise textual embeddings and incorporating region noise estimation.
